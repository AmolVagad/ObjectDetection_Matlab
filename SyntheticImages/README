 This package contains a set of 30 synthetic stereo image pairs at three 
different baseline separations, and three different amounts of noise. All images
were generated via a global illumination path tracer that also output a depth map
during rendering; all disparity maps were generated from these output depth maps.

 File structure is as follows:

Image files:
./N{0,1,2}/G{1,2,3}T{1,2,...,10}.L.png   -- Left image in pair
./N{0,1,2}/G{1,2,3}T{1,2,...,10}.R1.png  -- Right image, 15 pixel baseline
./N{0,1,2}/G{1,2,3}T{1,2,...,10}.R2.png  -- Right image, 30 pixel baseline
./N{0,1,2}/G{1,2,3}T{1,2,...,10}.R3.png  -- Right image, 45 pixel baseline

Ground truth disparity maps:
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.L1.gt.png -- Ground truth for 15 pixel baseline, left image
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.L2.gt.png -- Ground truth for 30 pixel baseline, left image
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.L3.gt.png -- Ground truth for 45 pixel baseline, left image
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.R1.gt.png -- Ground truth for 15 pixel baseline, right image
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.R2.gt.png -- Ground truth for 30 pixel baseline, right image
./Disparity/G{1,2,3}.R3.gt.png -- Ground truth for 45 pixel baseline, right image

Evaluation masks:
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.L1.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 15 pixel baseline, left image
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.L2.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 30 pixel baseline, left image
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.L3.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 45 pixel baseline, left image
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.R1.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 15 pixel baseline, right image
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.R2.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 30 pixel baseline, right image
./Masks/G{1,2,3}.R3.{all,disc,nocc,occ}.png -- Masks for 45 pixel baseline, right image

Notes:
 Noise level 0 (N0 directory) = "noise free"
 Noise level 1 (N1 directory) = Zero-mean Gaussian noise with std. deviation equal to 
                                the Sony DCR-TRV230 NTSC digital camera
 Noise level 2 (N2 directory) = As noise level 1 but, with double the std. deviation.

 G{1,2,3} in the filenames stand for geometric configuration. This dataset is built from
three different geometric configurations; each of which is textured in 10 ways.

 For the evaluation regions:
    all  = whole image, minus a border
    disc = areas within 10 pixels of a disparity discontinuity or an occluded region
    occ  = all occluded regions in the image
    nocc = all non-occluded regions in the image

 Ground truth images are scaled by the following scale factors:
    15 pixel baseline = x16 scaling
    30 pixel baseline = x8 scaling
    45 pixel baseline = x5 scaling
